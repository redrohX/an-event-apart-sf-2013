		<span class="author">Talk by Jeffrey Zeldman, author, Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Ed.</span>
		<h2>Ten Commandments of Modern Web Design</h2>
		<p>A nice starter talk where Zeldman gives us ten commandments of modern web design and development. All commandments are obviously based on facts and data that he gathered from his own projects and experiences. Some of the commandments sound quite obvious, but if you think about it, are not always executed in our own projects at Spil.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">Thou shalt entertain</li>
			<li class="delayed">Test everything (including assumptions)</li>
			<li class="delayed">Thou shalt iterate</li>
			<li class="delayed">Thou shalt ship</li>
			<li class="delayed">Engage the community</li>
			<li class="delayed">Love thy user as thyself</li>
			<li class="delayed">Remember the content and keep it holy</li>
			<li class="delayed">Thou shalt make magic</li>
			<li class="delayed">Thou shalt prioritize</li>

		<h2>Faster Design Decisions with Style Tiles</h2>
		<p>A talk about a way to deliver designs to clients by using style tiles. Designers have been doing this a certain way for many years (by delivering images or a multitude of images to the client) but this can be done in a much more future proof way by creating these so called style tiles. For Spil Games this could be a useful technique to explore during the project of the new responsive site.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">Style Tiles are a design deliverable consiting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Moodboards are too vague</li>
			<li class="delayed">Mockups work for really low budgets or sites that are being redefined, rather than redesigned. Works if expectations are set.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Style Tiles seperate style and structure</li>
			<li class="delayed">Style Tiles are device width agnostic</li>
			<li class="delayed">Design is about problem solving</li>
			<li class="delayed">Style tile process: Listen, Interpret, Define visual language, iterate</li>

		<h2>Universal Typography</h2>
		<p>In this talk Tim Brown showed us how to practice typography in a way that is universal. Focusing on traditional typographic principles while also embracing progressive enhancement. Tim explained how fonts, CSS, web-enabled devices, and user contexts coexist. </p>
		<p>This was a pretty dry talk about a very specific subject. It still was interesting and for Spil this is something we could look into for our new Girls project.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">How can we best set up fonts for different web-enabled devices?</li>
			<li class="delayed">Which fonts do we use?</li>
			<li class="delayed">What happens to the readability when we set up different breakpoints?</li>
			<li class="delayed">What's a good font-size and line-height?</li>
			<li class="delayed">Three different viewports, what to do?</li>
			<li class="delayed">Px, em, rem, percentages... What to use?</li>

		<h2>It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web</h2>
		<p>Luke's theory explained: we live in a write/read (mobile) web world. All succesful sites work when people add (write) content to them. </p>
		<p>Luke showed specific mobile examples and data (from his own projects and popular sites) how content creation can work for touch interfaces.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">In 2011 40% of all tweets created on mobile</li>
			<li class="delayed">How do we design for mobile creation?</li>
			<li class="delayed">One handed use, focused flows, just in time actions</li>
			<li class="delayed">How people use mobile devices and their posture</li>
			<li class="delayed">68% of consumer smartphone use happens at home</li>
			<li class="delayed">Examples on how to create complex interaction designs for touch screens</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Ethan Marcotte, Author, Responsive Web Design</span>
		<h2>The Map & The Territory</h2>
		<p>In this session Ethan revisited what we’ve learned about responsive design, and ensures our content is readily accessible wherever and whenever our users are.</p>
		<p>A talk interesting for Spil because we can create nice responsive sites, the content we host on our sites is incompatible with different devices. Ethan doesn't get into this specific kind of problem, but he does go through a couple of different techniques on how to set up content on responsive sites in terms of performance.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">By keeping your client side code small and lightweight, you can open your product up to new markets.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Trouble in responsive paradise?</li>
			<li class="delayed">A big issue we face with responsive sites is their performance</li>
			<li class="delayed">Sites can be anything between 50kb and 30mb nowadays.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Website weight average: 320kb in 2009, 1.6mb in 2013.</li>
			<li class="delayed">More people in Africa have access to a mobile phone than electricity.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Performance technique: Use SVG's as images</li>
			<li class="delayed">Performance technique: cutting the mustard (BBC technique, check if site is modern, if not show really basic version)</li>
			<li class="delayed">Selectively displaying data (hide data -- not remove -- if there is no room or bandwidth for it).</li>
			<li class="delayed">There are responsive image techniques we can use today already.</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Karen McGrane, author, Content Strategy for Mobile</span>
		<h2>The Mobile Content Mandate</h2>
		<p>You don’t get to decide which device people use to access your content: they do. In this session, Karen discussed why you need to deliver content wherever your customer wants to consume it. A very interesting talk for Spil, considering the focus on mobile and the challenge to make our content available cross-platform.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="delayed">44% of the Fortune 100 don't have a mobile site.</li>
			<li class="delayed">84% of consumer brands don't have a mobile strategy.</li>
			<li class="delayed">It's not a strategy if you can't maintain it.</li>
			<li class="delayed">There is no such thing as "how to write for mobile". There is just good writing.</li>
			<li class="delayed">Good content transcends platform!</li>
			<li class="delayed">Responsive design won't fix your content problem!</li>
			<li class="delayed">Don't create content for a specific context!</li>
			<li class="delayed">You don't get to decide which device people use to access your content!</li>
			<li class="delayed">Do mobile right. Right from the start!</li>

		<h2>The Long Web</h2>
		<p>In his talk Jeremy looks at design principles and development approaches that have stood the test of time. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, but those who can learn from the past will create a future-friendly web is his motto. Jeremy shows examples and techniques that he used in past and current projects. These are interesting for Spil, since they are a smart way of developing sites.</p>
