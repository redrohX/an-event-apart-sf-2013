		<span class="author">Talk by Jeffrey Zeldman, author, Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Ed.</span>
		<h2>Ten Commandments of Modern Web Design</h2>
		<p>A nice starter talk where Zeldman gives us ten commandments of modern web design and development. All commandments are obviously based on facts and data that he gathered from his own projects and experiences. Some of the commandments sound quite obvious, but if you think about it, are not always executed in our own projects at Spil.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Thou shalt entertain</li>
			<li>Test everything (including assumptions)</li>
			<li>Thou shalt iterate</li>
			<li>Thou shalt ship</li>
			<li>Engage the community</li>
			<li>Love thy user as thyself</li>
			<li>Remember the content and keep it holy</li>
			<li>Thou shalt make magic</li>
			<li>Thou shalt prioritize</li>
			<li>To thine own self be true</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Faster Design Decisions with Style Tiles</h2>
		<p>A talk about a way to deliver designs to clients by using style tiles. Designers have been doing this a certain way for many years (by delivering images or a multitude of images to the client) but this can be done in a much more future proof way by creating these so called style tiles. For Spil Games this could be a useful technique to explore during the project of the new responsive site.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Style Tiles are a design deliverable consiting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web.</li>
			<li>Moodboards are too vague</li>
			<li>Mockups work for really low budgets or sites that are being redefined, rather than redesigned. Works if expectations are set.</li>
			<li>Style Tiles seperate style and structure</li>
			<li>Style Tiles are device width agnostic</li>
			<li>Design is about problem solving</li>
			<li>Style tile process: Listen, Interpret, Define visual language, iterate</li>

		<h2>Universal Typography</h2>
		<p>In this talk Tim Brown showed us how to practice typography in a way that is universal. Focusing on traditional typographic principles while also embracing progressive enhancement. Tim explained how fonts, CSS, web-enabled devices, and user contexts coexist. </p>
		<p>This was a pretty dry talk about a very specific subject. It still was interesting and for Spil this is something we could look into for our new Girls project.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How can we best set up fonts for different web-enabled devices?</li>
			<li>Which fonts do we use?</li>
			<li>What happens to the readability when we set up different breakpoints?</li>
			<li>What's a good font-size and line-height?</li>
			<li>Three different viewports, what to do?</li>
			<li>Px, em, rem, percentages... What to use?</li>

		<h2>It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web</h2>
		<p>Luke's theory explained: we live in a write/read (mobile) web world. All succesful sites work when people add (write) content to them. </p>
		<p>Luke showed specific mobile examples and data (from his own projects and popular sites) how content creation can work for touch interfaces.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In 2011 40% of all tweets created on mobile</li>
			<li>How do we design for mobile creation?</li>
			<li>One handed use, focused flows, just in time actions</li>
			<li>How people use mobile devices and their posture</li>
			<li>68% of consumer smartphone use happens at home</li>
			<li>Examples on how to create complex interaction designs for touch screens</li>
			<li>Write/read multi-device web. How do we design for multi-device creation?</li>
			<li>One handed use, focused flows, just in time actions, cross device usage</li>
			<li>Cross device usage: access, flow, control, push</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Ethan Marcotte, Author, Responsive Web Design</span>
		<h2>The Map & The Territory</h2>
		<p>In this session Ethan revisited what we’ve learned about responsive design, and ensures our content is readily accessible wherever and whenever our users are.</p>
		<p>A talk interesting for Spil because we can create nice responsive sites, the content we host on our sites is incompatible with different devices. Ethan doesn't get into this specific kind of problem, but he does go through a couple of different techniques on how to set up content on responsive sites in terms of performance.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By keeping your client side code small and lightweight, you can open your product up to new markets.</li>
			<li>Trouble in responsive paradise?</li>
			<li>A big issue we face with responsive sites is their performance</li>
			<li>Sites can be anything between 50kb and 30mb nowadays.</li>
			<li>Website weight average: 320kb in 2009, 1.6mb in 2013.</li>
			<li>More people in Africa have access to a mobile phone than electricity.</li>
			<li>Performance technique: Use SVG's as images</li>
			<li>Performance technique: cutting the mustard (BBC technique, check if site is modern, if not show really basic version)</li>
			<li>Selectively displaying data (hide data -- not remove -- if there is no room or bandwidth for it).</li>
			<li>There are responsive image techniques we can use today already.</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Karen McGrane, author, Content Strategy for Mobile</span>
		<h2>The Mobile Content Mandate</h2>
		<p>You don’t get to decide which device people use to access your content: they do. In this session, Karen discussed why you need to deliver content wherever your customer wants to consume it. A very interesting talk for Spil, considering the focus on mobile and the challenge to make our content available cross-platform.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>44% of the Fortune 100 don't have a mobile site.</li>
			<li>84% of consumer brands don't have a mobile strategy.</li>
			<li>It's not a strategy if you can't maintain it.</li>
			<li>There is no such thing as "how to write for mobile". There is just good writing.</li>
			<li>Good content transcends platform!</li>
			<li>Responsive design won't fix your content problem!</li>
			<li>Don't create content for a specific context!</li>
			<li>You don't get to decide which device people use to access your content!</li>
			<li>Do mobile right. Right from the start!</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Jeremy Keith, Maker Of Websites</span>
		<h2>The Long Web</h2>
		<p>In his talk Jeremy looks at design principles and development approaches that have stood the test of time. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, but those who can learn from the past will create a future-friendly web is his motto. Jeremy shows examples and techniques that he used in past and current projects. These are interesting for Spil, since they are a smart way of developing sites.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mobile first</li>
			<li>Content first</li>
			<li>URL first</li>
			<li>Navigation second</li>
			<li>Be aware of different input methods</li>
			<li>Progressive enhancement</li>
			<li>Use SVG's as images where possible</li>
			<li>SVG's can be made responsive.</li>
			<li>JavaScript can be used inside SVG's.</li>
			<li>Use conditional loading</li>

		<span class="author">Talk by Chris Coyier, Author, CSS-Tricks.com</span>
		<h2>Preprocessing is for Everybody</h2>
		<p>In this presentation Chris looked into how preprocessors fit into modern web development. He gave us tips and tricks to convince the boss and colleagues, best practices for using preprocessors, and how to squeeze out all the benefits we can get from them. Still interesting enough for Spil, even if we're already using Sass in the new architecture.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Stepping up our abstraction allows us to manage that complexity.</li>
			<li>Preprocessing is an abstraction. It makes working on websites easier.</li>
			<li>Besides Sass there is Stylus and Less. Sass is most robust language. Biggest active community.</li>
			<li>Preprocessing HTML and JS is cool, but not as powerful as CSS preprocessing.</li>
			<li>Sass simplifies development and lowers the complexity of our site.</li>
			<li>Every Sass tool is built for more consistency.</li>
			<li>Make the sites faster with concatenated and compressed CSS.</li>
			<li>Sass learning period is short. You don't need to rewrite everything right away.</li>
			<li>Transitioning to Sass is easy. All .css files are valid .scss files.</li>
			<li>With a little DevOps, writing in Sass can be easier than writing CSS.</li>

		<h2>Deep CSS Secrets</h2>
		<p>In her presentation Lea presented and live coded ten advanced CSS tricks that are great to know and even pretty useful. You can find her presentation <a href="http://lea.verou.me/more-css-secrets/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're curious about the tricks. Not all browsers are supported, but a couple of these tricks are progressive enhanced, so they will only show if the browser is up to date enough and nothing will happen if you're using an old browser.</p>

		<span class="author">Talk by Mike Monteiro, Design Director, Mule Design</span>
		<h2>How Designers Destroyed the World</h2>
		<p>Mike Monteiro's presentation was quite an eye-opener. Every day, designers (and developers as well) all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This has to change and Mike's honest and confrontational talk was possibly the highlight of the conference. As a reference: think Fight Club meets web design and presented by Bill Hicks. This is definitely useful for Spil Games. I think we can learn a lot from this presentation in terms of responsibility and creating good products.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First example was how bad design of the privacy settings at Facebook ruined someone's life.</li>
			<li>They (Facebook) ignored the bad design. They ran it up the chain. Chain of command ignored it.</li>
			<li>You can pull the plug on something that sucks.</li>
			<li>Don't fear taking responsibility... fear causing harm.</li>
			<li>YOU are responsible for what YOU put into the world.</li>
			<li>What goes on the web goes through US!</li>
			<li>The monsters we unleash into the world will be named after us.</li>
			<li>You have more power than you think! You have more responsibility than you realize.</li>
			<li>Write. Speak. Teach.</li>
			<li>The work we choose to take on defines us.</li>
			<li>"Drops the mic and walks away..."</li>

		<h2>Just Enough Research</h2>
		<p>In her talk Erika explains that countless strangers will be using our creations in a chaotic environment over which we have no control. Research is the key to grounding ideas in reality and improving the odds of success, but research can be a very scary word. Learn practical, effective, efficient techniques that work within any design and development process to give you invaluable insight into your users and what they need and value.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Why research? You assumptions are not the same as the real world.</li>
			<li>Wrong: We don't have the time.</li>
			<li>Wrong: We don't the money.</li>
			<li>Wrong: We don't have the expertise.</li>
			<li>Wrong: We're already A/B testing.</li>
			<li>Wrong: We can just build a prototype.</li>
			<li>Wrong: Steve Jobs didn't need to do research.</li>
			<li>Learning by failure leaves needs unment. Unmet needs are the right problems to solve.</li>
			<li>Design research is not enough</li>
			<li>Research is not asking people what they like/hate.</li>
			<li>Form questions -> Gather data/think critically/observe/interview/experiment/read -> Analyze data</li>

		<h2>It’s a Great Time To Be a UX Designer</h2>
		<p>In his talk Jared claims the demand for great design has never been higher! Yet, while we’re presented with more opportunities than ever, we also face increased challenges. Mobile design requires us to rethink how we design for screens and interaction. Agile methodology forces us to critically reevaluate best processes and techniques.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Design: the rendering of intent.</li>
			<li>Imitation: Less expensive, less risky. Design not valued. Viewed as commodity.</li>
			<li>Innovation: More expensive, more risky. Design heavily valued. Viewed as competitive.</li>
			<li>Business wins when it's intentionally innovative.</li>
			<li>Business wins when it values designers.</li>
			<li>Design is about the <del>visual</del> business.</li>
			<li>Great business models are intentionally designed.</li>
			<li>Business needs designers everywhere.</li>
			<li>Innovation is not adding new inventions. Innovation is adding new value.</li>

		<span class="author">Workshop by Luke Wroblewski, CEO & Co-Founder of Input Factory Inc.</span>
		<h2>The Web Everywhere – Multi-Device Web Design 1/3</h2>
		<p>Luke's workshop wasn't really a hands-ons session because of the huge number of attendees. It was more like a college session where Luke explains that the web no longer starts and ends on our desktop. Designing for a cross/multi-device world requires new ways of thinking and doing business.</p>
		<p>This was a really useful presentation. Luke managed to give a very interesting six hour presentation on building sites for multi-device web. We shouldn't focus on specific devices, but on our users who are using multiple devices. This is already happening and focusing on one or a couple of specific experiences is not the way to go forward.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Samsung alone already has about 30 different screen sizes available in their touch products.</li>
			<li>The way we interact with our devices is changing (touch, mouse, voice).</li>
			<li>Resolutions are different across all devices (so don't target on resolution).</li>
			<li>Support a continuum of screens</li>
			<li>Account for high resolution</li>
			<li>Optimize for touch</li>
			<li>Support cursors & keyboard</li>
			<li>Smartphones & tablets use overtook PC use around 2011</li>
			<li>Design and build mobile first</li>

		<h2>The Web Everywhere – Multi-Device Web Design 2/3</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Good news: You only need one web design: a multi-device design.</li>
			<li>Bad news: it's a new & different way of doing web design.</li>
			<li>Responsive web design: fluid grids, flexible images, media queries.</li>
			<li>Navigation elements: start with mobile considerations.</li>
			<li>Navigation elements: adapt as more screen space is available.</li>
			<li>Navigation elements: support touch ergonomics.</li>
			<li>Start with mobile.</li>
			<li>Enhance upward.</li>
			<li>Build fluidly.</li>
			<li>Screen continuum: Responsive web design, breakpoints, multi-device design patterns, avoid mobile stacks.</li>
			<li>Create content-based break points. Not based on resolution.</li>
			<li>"The more you tweak based on a squishy browser window the less testing for specific devices you'll need."</li>
			<li>Use multi-device layout patterns.</li>

		<h2>The Web Everywhere – Multi-Device Web Design 3/3</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Use high resolution images where possible (there are solutions you can already use).</li>
			<li>Use scalable vector graphics (SVG) for icons, logo's and every images that's not a photo.</li>
			<li>SVG's can have media queries inside.</li>
			<li>Performance is important. 86% of responsive sites send same content to mobile.</li>
			<li>RWD forces you to think about what's really needed on your page.</li>
			<li>40% of users will abandon your site after 3 seconds of waiting it to load.</li>
			<li>Manage performance: perceived performance, client-side enhancements, server-side components.</li>
			<li>Reduce requests & file size.</li>
			<li>Take advantage of HTML5 etc.</li>
			<li>Perception of fast performance is important.</li>
			<li>Initial state: Ajax-Include content. Start lightweight and accesible without JavaScript.</li>
			<li>Expanded state: Ajax-request referenced content and inject it into the page.</li>
			<li>Set a max performance "budget".</li>
			<li>Responsive design + server side optimization = RESS</li>
